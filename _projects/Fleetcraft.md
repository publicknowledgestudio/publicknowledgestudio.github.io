Fleetcraft is an AI-native aviation startup building tools to help aircraft maintenance teams reduce turnaround time by automating paperwork, document retrieval, and compliance logging. We designed and built the Fleetcraft website, translating their technical mission into a clear, compelling digital presence that communicates their vision of making the skies more accessible.
