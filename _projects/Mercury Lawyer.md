# Brief

Mercury Lawyer is a legal technology product that monitors Indian courts and delivers case alerts to lawyers within minutes of publication. The platform provides a unified workspace for tracking hearings, reviewing orders, and managing case information across court complexes. We contributed the brand identity and UI/UX design, shaping how legal professionals interact with Mercury's real-time tracking and notification features.
